The rebranded Nike website, powered by AI-driven design principles, introduces enhanced functionality centered around user interaction and streamlined navigation. Key features include a dynamic product display with a real-time image slideshow in the hero section, a responsive shopping cart system, and a single-page layout for faster browsing. Users can add products directly to their cart and proceed to a minimal checkout flow that prompts for name and address, delivering instant confirmation. The routing is handled seamlessly with React Router, ensuring smooth transitions between the home and checkout pages. Tailwind CSS was used for vibrant styling, and the site is fully deployable via GitHub Pages without Firebase dependency.
